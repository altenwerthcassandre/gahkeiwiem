                            <p> Hi! As the title says, is the How to Paint Citadel Miniatures: Dwarfs worth it? I thinking about buying some dwarf miniatures and I would an instruction on how to paint them. I own the one about High Elves, and that one I found really good. I'm sorry, if I should have submitted this post on another subreddit. I was wondering if anybody knows if the how to paint citadel miniatures book is up to date with the new paints. \ H\ New list – massive amount of 40K, Age of Sigmar, Kill Team, Warhammer Quest, LOTR, Imperial Knights, paints and books boxed unused items\ W\ PayPal \ Loc\ UK Willing to ship worldwide at cost to the buyer. Most items are priced at 65% or less of GW RRP with a few small exceptions which are at 70%. All items listed are either sealed or if not are complete with bases and instructions. Almost everything is current GW stock items. Where I have written the item titles, these Does anyone have any high res pictures or a copy of "how to paint citadel miniatures: deathwatch", i ask because everywhere i look to purchase the item it says sold out. Any help would be greatly appreciated as i am only just starting with Warhammer thanks to kill team, Thanks. Just curious, does the How to Paint Citadel Miniatures: Tau Empire guide that is on the GW shop right now contain mostly guides for the Vior’la Sept color scheme? That is the one I am interested in and would like to emulate, but I don’t want to pay  for a digital guide if it turns out to have only half the tutorials for the scheme I want. I saw a flip-through on youtube but I believe it was an older guide. However it also had the Vior’la color scheme on the cover but it looked Warhammer to Blood Bowl Lizardman conversions in (semi-)standard GW Lizardman colors using paints I already have. RMS Green Ochre or RMS Saffron Sunset instead of GW Averland Yellow? I'm converting Warhammer Fantasy (I mean, um, Age of Sigmarines.) skinks and sauruses into a Blood Bowl Lizardman team. I am using the How to Paint Citadel Miniatures Lizardmen book as a color guide, but placing the colors differently: yellow(ish) skin instead of warpaint, black scales, blue-green loincloth.

I'm thinking of a paint job for some AoS Chaos Warriors I've got kicking around, but I haven't got access to my stuff at the moment to check them out. Does anyone have any pictures of any metallic paint (leadbelcher, etc) coated with a yellow/orange glaze? The old How To Paint Citadel Miniatures for Chaos Warriors had a Tzeentch Knight done like that with a blue/green glaze mix and it looked good, but I want a non-god specific paint scheme. Cheers. Hi guys! I'm a big lurker here, I'm pretty new to the hobby but my dad painted a lot a long time ago. I paint mostly old chainmail miniatures from my dad.

Is there a specific set that will last me a while if I care for them and be nice quality, but nice to my wallet as well? I have the 'How to Paint Citadel Miniatures' book and their paint brush set looks good, but it seems. All sold!
